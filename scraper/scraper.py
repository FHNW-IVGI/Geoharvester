title: Scraper a.k.a Geoharvester
Author: David Oesch
Date: 2022-11-05
Purpose: Retrieve information about a web map service and save it to a file
Notes:
- Uses Python 3.9
- Uses the OWSLib library to access the geo services
- Processes the service information to extract the layer names and other details
- Writes the extracted information to  files for future use

    Extracts information from an OGC web service (WMS, WMTS, WFS) using the

    if the service is a Web Map Service (WMS), Web Map Tile Service (WMTS), or 
    Web Feature Service (WFS) based on the version number in the source URL. If 
    the version number is invalid, the function writes an error message to a 
    log file.

    WebMapTileService, or WebFeatureService from the OWSLib library. The 
    function then loops through all the layers in the service contents and 
    checks if the layer is a parent or child layer. For each layer, the function 
    calls write_service_info to write the service information and layer tree.

    If an error occurs, the function writes an error message to a log file and 
    returns False.

    Writes the processed data in First Normal Form (NF1) to two output files:
    one with detailed information and one with simple information (title and 
    map geo link). This function reads data from a CSV file and processes it to 
    bring the data into first normal form (NF1) with one entry per dataset. The 
    processed data is then written to two output files.

    Inputs
    csv_filename: the name of the input CSV file
    output_file: the name of the output file for the full dataset information
    output_simple_file: the name of the output file for the simplified dataset 
        information

    Functionality
    1. Store processed dataset IDs in geo_data_done to avoid processing the 
       same dataset multiple times.
    2. Loop over all rows in the CSV file and filter for unique datasets by 
       comparing the title, name, and provider fields.
    3. For each unique dataset, create a new empty layer using the 
       service_result_empty function and update it with the dataset information.
    4. If there are multiple datasets with the same title, name, and provider, 
       combine the information from all datasets into a single layer.
    5. Perform post-processing on the dataset information, such as removing 
       duplicates from the keywords field and updating the service links 
       (WMSGetCap, WMTSGetCap, WFSGetCap) based on the service and 
       endpoint fields in the CSV file. Write the processed dataset 
       information to the output files using the write_file function, with 
       different keys for each file.
    6. The full dataset information is written to output_file, while a 
       simplified version containing only the provider, title, and preview fields 
       is written to output_simple_file.

    Parameters:
    csv_filename: str
        Path to the source CSV file
    output_file: str
        Path to the output file with detailed information
    output_simple_file: str
